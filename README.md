# Description 
This repository contains a small code to perform classical MD. 
It performs MD through NVE ensemble by using periodic boundary condition (PBC). 
Only Lennard-Jones and Harmonic potentials are used to respectively describe 
non-bonded and bonded interactions on atoms. 


# Compile & Use 
The code is written in FORTRAN95
